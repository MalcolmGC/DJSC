# DJSC
DoneJS Chat Example in stages.
Application was renamed to djs-chat instead of donejs-chat because of the limited characters in the Firebase: donejs-chat=MalcolmGC is one character too long.
AT the initial posting of the local repo (Through change 8.), app was deployed on Firebase, but deletes previous message when a new one is "added".
localhost:8080 works fine.
Note: Not using "donejs-chat" causes problems because some files seem to be hard wired -- about 6 changes to djs-chat were required.
